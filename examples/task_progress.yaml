  The goal is to increase /tmp/codexapi_work_done.txt towards 5 by incrementing it once and then return control to the user/verifier agent for their feedback before doing so again. Step by step is the way. Initialize at 0 if it does not exist. Verifier: report success when the value has reached the target.
